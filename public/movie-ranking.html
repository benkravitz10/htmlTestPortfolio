<h1>My top 3 movies!</h1>
<h2>Because I said so...</h2>

<hr/>

<h2>Spaceballs</h2>
<p>It's just too damn funny. Everything about it, especially since I don't like Star Wars.</p>

<h2>Grown Ups 1 & 2</h2>
<p>Both of theses were hysterical, with the perfect cast. The 2nd was comedy gold, with Shaq being afraid of his older, 
    yet shorter brother. Meanwhile, Shaq towered over him.</p>

<h2>The Super Mario Movie</h2>
<p>It lived up to everything I wanted in a Super Mario Bros Movie. There were so many references to the games. I loved it.</p>
